                The 200 year journey starts at the fateful year of 1824 where a man named <span class="span_text">John Cadbury</span> decided to make a shop where he could sell coffee, tea and drinking chocolate. This store was located in the UK, Birminghame on Bull street. After a few years of business he decided to move and start his factory production in cocoa and drinking chocolate. The company got a big change from 1847 as he partnered up with his brother benjimin and named the company <span class="span_text">"Cadbury Brothers"</span>. The company introduced their first chocolate bar in 1849 and 5 years later recieved the <span class="span_text">royal warrent</span>, meant they were the main manufactures of chocolate for Queen Victoria.

                Sadly in 1861 <span class="span_text">John Cadbury's</span> health was in repid decline so he had to transfer ownership. His sons <span class="span_text">Richard and George Cadbury</span> took over as the business was in decline. The workers had reduced and it wasn't until 1866, 5 years later that the company was finally profitable again. The brothers did this by changing the focus from coffee and tea to chocolate. The same year, the brothers introduced a new impproved cocoa into Britain. It was 1875 that the first easter egg was made, as they developed a cocoa butter that could be molded into a smooth shape.

                The <span class="span_text">Bournville Estate</span> was built in 1878. It was built with the thought of transport of their products. It had easy access to the canals, nearby access of trains. It was the best place for production on a mass scale. The <span class="span_text">Bournville factory</span> was opened in 1879.

                In 1893, 120 acres of land was bought for plan George Cadbury had thought of. This land was close to the Bournville estate. All this was done at the own expense of George. After a few years of building in 1900 the 120 acres became 330 acres of land and the estate had 314 cottages and houses. Also as a fun fact, as the Cadbury family were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers" target="_blank">Quakers</a> there were no pubs in the estate.

                The Famed <span class="span_text">Cadbury Bar</span> was launched in 1905. They were the first company to be able to mass-produce milk chocolate. In 1915 the <span class="span_text">Milk tray</span> was produced. Cadbury as a company helped support the nation during the First World War by providing chocolate, clothes and books to the troops. George Cadbury even handed over two-company owned buildings to be used as hospitals which are know as today as <span class="span_text">"The Beeches"</span> and <span class="span_text">"Fircroft"</span>. After the war in 1918 the company built their first over-seas factory in Hobart, Tasmania.
