<br>
<h3>Testing</h3>
    I came across a few problems that needed to be fixed:
        When trying to set up the layout of the timeline i came across the problem of that each box would keep sitting next to each other. To fix this i ordered the dates to be next to each other and the same for the information boxs

        While trying to get the Products list on the company page, it wouldn't show the black circles. To fix this i found that i did not surround the "<a>" in a <li> so it was added on and got fixed.

<br>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
    A few bugs i have encounted that would need to be fixed but i feel i would more experience in coding to help me fix them:
        When i tried adding the code so the site can be compatable with all devices it striped my code of all the CSS styles. Also due to the extent of time it would take for me to change all of the layout of the pages to allow compatability this was the other reason i couldn't do this. I will need mote training as the course goes on to help me with how things can be designed to better fit the needs of a website.
